CSS Flexbox

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

The flexbox properties are supported in all modern browsers.

Flexbox Elements
To start using the Flexbox model, you need to first define a flex container.

flex-direction
flex-wrap
flex-flow
justify-content
align-items
align-content

The flex-direction Property
The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.
Example
The column value stacks the flex items vertically (from top to bottom):
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

Example
The column-reverse value stacks the flex items vertically (but from bottom to top):
Then the row-reverse value stacks the flex items horizontally (but from right to left):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}
Example
The row value stacks the flex items horizontally (from left to right):
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

The flex-wrap Property
The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.

The examples below have 12 flex items, to better demonstrate the flex-wrap property.


The flex-wrap Property
The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.

The examples below have 12 flex items, to better demonstrate the flex-wrap property.
The wrap value specifies that the flex items will wrap if necessary:
The nowrap value specifies that the flex items will not wrap (this is default):
The wrap-reverse value specifies that the flexible items will wrap if necessary, in reverse order:

The flex-flow Property
The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

Example
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}

Perfect Centering
In the following example we will solve a very common style problem: perfect centering.
Set both the justify-content and align-items properties to center, and the flex item will be perfectly centered:
