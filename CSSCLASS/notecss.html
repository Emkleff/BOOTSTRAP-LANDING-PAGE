When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the html document according to the informatio in the style sheet.

Three ways to insert css
*External css
*Internal css
*Inline Css
External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element.

CSS Selectors:-
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

types of Selectors
Simple Selectors :-
*Element Selector
*id selector
*class selector

grouping selectors
universal Selector
combinators selector
psuedo class-Selector
psuedo element-Selector

The element Selector:-
The element selector is the html tag name, just like calling your h1,p,div etc.

The CSS id Selector:-
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

The CSS class Selector:-
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

The CSS Grouping Selector:-
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions) so they'll be styled together

h1,h2,p {

}

The CSS Universal Selector:-
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.


CSS Combinators
A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
